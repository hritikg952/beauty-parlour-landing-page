      <h1>OUR PHILOSOPHY</h1>
      <p>
        At the Beauty Parlour, we believe in beauty with a conscience. We have
        created a salon that offers the highest quality hair services in a
        setting that is healthier for the environment, our guests and our staff.
        The Beauty Parlour is designed and built primarily with recycled
        materials: the floor is made of reclaimed wood from a local grain
        elevator – preserving and showcasing its natural texture – and most of
        the fixtures and furniture are refurbished or original vintage pieces.
      </p>
      <p>
        We carry high quality professional hair products designed to ensure our
        guests look their best, both in the salon and at home. The hair care
        products we carry have been carefully chosen based both on performance
        and eco-sensitivity. As a clean air salon, we offer ammonia-free colour
        services with little to no scent properties or chemical emanation. This
        healthier alternative to traditional colouring practices is also safe
        for expectant mothers and individuals with allergies or scent
        sensitivities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our design and philosophy work hand in hand. We are committed to
        providing healthy hair care with a low impact on the environment. Come
        see what you and your hair can do for the Earth.
